A library of useful helper functions to the Indigo computational chemistry toolkit, written in Python. These functions mostly generate molecular properties that aren't available in the core Indigo library.

## Installation
Make sure you have a working version of the Indigo Python bindings installed. Please follow the [installation guide on EPAM's website](http://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/indigo/index.html). 

Clone this repo and move it into your PYTHONPATH.

To check that everything's working correctly unit tests are included. To run them:

    python tests.py
    
## Modules
murcko.py - Generate the Bemis-Murcko framework of an Indigo object.

murcko_alpha.py - Generate the Bemis-Murcko framework of an Indigo object with the alpha connection atoms intact.

reaction.py - Run a chemical reaction by specifying a SMARTS string and one or two SMILES strings.

rotatable_bonds.py - Find the number of rotatable bonds in a molecule.

sp3carbon.py - Calculate the number of carbon atoms, sp3 hybridised carbon atoms and sp3 fraction of a SMILES string.

tpsa.py - Compute the topological polar surface area of a molecule specified as a SMILES string. Derived from code from the [Chemistry Toolkit Rosetta Wiki](http://ctr.wikia.com/wiki/Calculate_TPSA).
